        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook
        for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Step 2 Preheat oven to 350
        degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat,
        brown beef and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti
        sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes. Step 3 In a medium bowl, combine
        mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate
        layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.
        Step 4 Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted
        and bubbly.
